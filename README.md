# System Destroyer

Running these files may cause the system to crash.
For your further learning, I have written these codes in four favorite languages ‚Äã‚Äãof hackers.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `Folder Bomber.*`
  ‚û§ These codes create an infinite number of folders with consecutive names from 1 to N and cause the operating system to crash.
  ‚û§ python "Folder Bomber.py"
  ‚û§ gcc "Folder Bomber.c" -o "Folder-Bomber.exe" & .\Folder-Bomber.exe
  ‚û§ go run "Folder Bomber.go"
  ‚û§ "Folder Bomber.ps1"
- `RAM and CPU consumption.*`
  ‚û§ They fill up the CPU and RAM for no reason, causing the operating system to hang.
  ‚û§ python "RAM and CPU consumption.py"
  ‚û§ gcc "RAM and CPU consumption.c" -o "RAM-and-CPU-consumption.exe" & .\RAM-and-CPU-consumption.exe
  ‚û§ go run "RAM and CPU consumption.go"
  ‚û§ "RAM and CPU consumption.ps1"
- `URL Bomber.*`
  ‚û§ Opening the browser to Google address too quickly causes the browser to crash and the operating system to freeze. Unfortunately, because you can't directly open a browser in C, I avoided writing the code for this virus in C.
  ‚û§ python "URL Bomber.py"
  ‚û§ go run "URL Bomber.py"
  ‚û§ "URL Bomber.ps1"
